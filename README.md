# peterscraper

Scraping websites with clj-http and enlive for fun and no profit. Especially sites that need awkward POST submissions

## Installation

Clone via git

## Usage

Mostly I play with it in the REPL in the scraper namespace, so the following won't do much...

    $ java -jar peterscraper-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]
